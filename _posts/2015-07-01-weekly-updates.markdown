# Center for Child and Law

_30th December 2016, at CCL, NLS Bangalore at around 11 AM._

We introduced our project to Mr. Niranjan. The discussion went as follows:

1. He said that we should rather do a case study of these two schools we have choosen for the field project.
2. The case study will involve us creating a checklist of things which shoud be present in SDMC as per the Act.
Then analysing the gap between law and implementation.
3. For understanding the gap, we have to interview and chit-chat with SDMC members.
4. We propose that we should create a modle SDMC in the two schools we have selected for that he suggested we need
creat a strong link between panchyat and SDMC.
5. We have also concluded that the permisssion from BO with a letter from college(for that we will need your  help. is
a must.
6. The tentative next step will be the one awareness program for each schools.
7. We asked for good functioning SDMC schools, he then invited us to visit SDMCs at Ramnagar Schools
8. We were also told about CCL office in Bidadi which is engaged in SDMC project which we plan to visit after our initial study.
9. To gather information on SDMC and related laws, we were informed by Sir to look at Karnataka Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Rules, 2009.

# Meeting with an SDMC member (Mother of one of the kids at the school)

_1st Feb 2017_

The meeting was planned because she is a SDMC member of one of the schools we are working at. That’s another story that she was not aware that she was one!!

She was hesitant to meet because she thought that being an illiterate female she is just not the right person to meet. There were lot of navigation problems as she wasn’t able to guide us properly to her home. After crossing all the barriers, we finally managed to see her!

Their house was only a small little room, which was her bedroom and her kitchen and her puja room and her dressing. Once she met us, she seemed relaxed to talk and opened up quite a bit. She appeared to be warm and loving, she even offered us to stay back to have dinner which she was going to make.

She said she did not know that she was a SDMC member. But she is ready to go to the meeting if it benefits her kid; she wants her to become a doctor. She said that she is worried that her child has to sit on roads to have her food and doesn’t get the milk which she is suppose to get.
